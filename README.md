# unity_appsflyer_sdk 

AppsFlyer‚Äôs Unity SDK provides mobile app installation and event recording functionality for Android and iOS Unity projects. You can record installs, updates, and sessions and also record post-installs events (including in-app purchases, game levels, etc.) to evaluate ROI and user engagement levels.

Mobile apps, that are developed on the Unity platform, can integrate AppsFlyer's SDK once and attribution installs for both Android and iOS generated apps. The following guide details how to integrate AppsFlyer's SDK into your Unity code for your iOS and Android apps.
